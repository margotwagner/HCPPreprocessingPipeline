These are custom scripts necessary for ${HCPPIPEDIR}/FreeSurfer/FreeSurferPipeline.sh

They modify the default v6.0 recon-all to:

1) better handle high spatial resolution (< 1 mm voxels) structurals
(by placing the surfaces onto the high resolution inputs), including
pial surface refinement using the T2

2) accomodate the HCP with some additional functionality

Make sure the directory that these files are in,
${HCPPIPEDIR}/FreeSurfer/custom, is on your PATH before running
FreeSurferPipeline.sh. (If not, this directory will be prepended to your
PATH by the FreeSurferPipeline.sh itself).
